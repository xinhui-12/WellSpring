This is my BAIT2073 Mobile Application Development Assignment. This is a step tracking application that will track how many steps you have taken with achievement feature, calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) features and a mini game feature where you can rare different pets, feed them, play with them or even make them wear clothes. With every 100 steps taken, you can earn 1 in-game coin and coins are used to buy foods, toys, clothes, different pets or even voucher codes! This application also provide a simple BMI calculator with history chart to track whether your BMI is increase or decrease across time. This mobile application database is using the firebase to store all the data.

Strength:
⦁ Step tracking that will allow you to earn in-game currency which motivates you to take more steps!
⦁ Mini game features to allow you to interact with your pets.
⦁ Calculate your BMI on the spot with history feature that is presented using graphical mode to track your BMI status.
⦁ Achievement feature that will keep you motivated so you will do more exercises!
⦁ Profile system that allow you to register an account and manage your account easily.

Weakness:
⦁ The voucher code is a random string generated so it is not a real code since this is just a prototype and we have not integrate with any e-commerce applcations yet.
